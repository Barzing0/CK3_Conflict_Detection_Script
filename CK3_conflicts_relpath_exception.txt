# Not processing these paths can be wrong, since it's possible to overwrite the vanilla keys (by overwritting vanilla file), 
# but normally they shouldn't be overwriten since mechanisms are available to avoid this, check file in corresponding local game directory : 
# _on_actions.info, music_categories.txt
# Still check game file overwritting
